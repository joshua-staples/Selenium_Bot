# Overview

I have wanted to learn to build a bot for a long time, and so this is my first project in dipping my toes into the world of browser automation with Selenium. 

I chose to write a bot for Amazon that will add a product to your cart and go through the entire checkout process for you.

As technology advances we tend to be fighting against bots to buy the products we want, so why not build one myself to counter that inconvenience?
